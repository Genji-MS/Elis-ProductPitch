**Genji Tapia:** 


**Can Elis come outside to play 'Pitch Ready':** 


**Old Project?**


**Solo, but has had prior colaborators?**


## Description

**Codename 'Imaginary Friends' is a videogame inspired from a dream. Work started last summer, however some components in the game were created 1-2 years ago as a class project, some assets have been purchased, or created in colaboration with others. Since the project officially began, the game has developed from a crude prototype into a playable demo. Over spring break, the game has been played by former classmates, and one game design teacher. The current state of the game needs itteration into a playable prototype ready for pitching to potential invenstors.**
**Gameplay consists of two scenes. The Overworld, where a player can traverse a map and visit key locations to 'Train' - Learn the games unique controls, 'Converse' - view the dialog engine, and how story is delivered to the player, and 'Battle' - A difficult battle intended to show off the complexities of combat, and a higher level of play that approaches mastery. The first scene transitions into the Combat scene, where a player experiences the dynamics of a unique battle system, and transitions back into the Overworld to create an endless game loop where the player is free to explore the game's potential.**

## Challenges I Anticipate

**Time! Having the intensive divided between this project and building my MS portfolio creates a conflict of work flow**

## Skateboard

**Integrating feedback received in the way of alternate game controlls from the one that the game currently uses. One feedback to follow-up on is to present the game with the new controlls to people who are very skilled at rhythm games, to see how they respond to the more favorable control scheme.**

## Bike
**Implement additional game-changing spells, such as the 'BOLT' spell that will leap unto nearby enemies**

## Car
**Integrate the game with the Django feedback form for future gametesting** 

## Personal Achievement Goals:

**Each teammate must achieve 2 of 3 of their self-set personal achievement goals. If you're not on a team, delete the other teammate sections as needed.**

### Teammate 1

1. Add in the 'death/victory' delay before transitioning back to the Overworld scene
2. Add in a 'death' animation for all player characters.
3. Add in the themed transition which displays the games title image.
4. Implement a different controller style where movement doesn't need to be 'confirmed' by an action
5. Selectable option to remove 'stun lock' from the player characters, which prevents players actions unbuffered. (IE, you need to mash attack until you are able to do so.). Optionally, implement action buffering.
6. Move on to 'Bike' tasks
